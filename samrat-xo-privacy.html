                <p>Samrat XO integrates Google AdMob and Firebase Analytics to improve user experience and display
                    advertisements.
                    While we do not directly collect any personal user data, these services may collect and process
                    certain

                        interactions,

                    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Firebase Analytics helps us understand user behavior, app
                        performance,

                    <li><strong>Personalized and Non-Personalized Ads:</strong> Depending on user consent, AdMob may use

                    <li><strong>Third-Party Data Sharing:</strong> AdMob and Firebase Analytics may share anonymized or
